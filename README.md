# Poison-Test-1
Hello, completely new here trying to learn C# and Unity, here is a little Poison script demo.

https://answers.unity.com/questions/1675746/poison-script-working-but-how-do-i-properly-stack.html

I have 3 questions:

1. How can I properly stack this effect? If the bolt repeatedly hits player while the poison script is running, the health subtraction instances will stack,  but once the first instance returns "_is poisoned" to default (false), then all the instances are stopped, even if they have just begun.

 2. If I set a "Use Antidote" button to SpaceBar, how should I go about making an antidote that would terminate all running instances of this effect?

 3. How would you clean up and condense this further?

Thank you for your time!
